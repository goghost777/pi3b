It's designed to help streamline my workflow, automate common tasks, and speed up the setup process whenever I need to rebuild or replicate the same environment in the future.

Whether it's configuring the system, installing software, optimizing performance, or deploying services like FTP servers, Docker containers, or development environments â€” this repo serves as my go-to toolbox.

Custom setup scripts for faster provisioning
Configuration files (system, network, software)
Pre-written commands and automation snippets
Workflow enhancements and shortcuts
Notes, tips, and troubleshooting references
Purpose:
This repo helps me:

Save time setting up fresh Raspberry Pi installations
Maintain consistency across rebuilds or multiple devices
